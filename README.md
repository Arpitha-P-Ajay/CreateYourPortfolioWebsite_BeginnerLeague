### Beginner's League

# Challenge - Create your Portfolio Website
Create a personal portfolio website to showcase who you are, what you’ve learned, and what you can do! This is your space on the internet — make it yours. Use basic HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.

This portfolio website is built using only HTML and CSS, with no external pages linked except for LinkedIn and GitHub :)
I experimented with CSS animations and transitions—especially the changing words, which were achieved purely with CSS.
The website is Responsive.
